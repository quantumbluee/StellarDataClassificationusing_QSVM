# StellarDataClassificationusing_QSVM
**Problem Statement:**   
Implementing a Quantum State Vector Machine to solve a machine learning problem.

**About the Dataset:**  
In astronomy, stellar classification is the classification of stars based on their spectral characteristics. The classification scheme of galaxies, quasars, and stars is one of the most fundamental in astronomy. The early cataloguing of stars and their distribution in the sky has led to the understanding that they make up our own galaxy and, following the distinction that Andromeda was a separate galaxy to our own, numerous galaxies began to be surveyed as more powerful telescopes were built. This datasat aims to classificate stars, galaxies, and quasars based on their spectral characteristics.

**Implementation:**  
The implementation has been done on Jupyter Notebook. A ZZFeatureMap is used to encode the classical data into quantum data. The code gives an accuracy of 86%.
